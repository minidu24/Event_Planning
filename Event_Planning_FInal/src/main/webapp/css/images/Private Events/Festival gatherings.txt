01) Set concrete goals for your festival

The first step in festival planning is setting clear goals. Your goals act as a guide, providing direction for your planning process. Here are some example objectives to assist you in goal-setting:

1. Raise awareness of your nonprofit in your local community.
2. Generate funds for your nonprofit's programs or projects.
3. Establish your festival as the premier summer event in your town.
4. Provide the most eco-friendly festival experience.
5. Implement stringent health and safety measures.
6. Increase engagement on social media and media coverage for your cause.

Once you've chosen your overarching aims, define specific goals with measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These KPIs help track progress toward your objectives. For instance:

1. Increase ticket sales by 20% compared to the previous year.
2. Generate $25,000 in donations through ticket sales.
3. Gain 500 new social media followers.
4. Add 500 new subscribers to your email newsletter.
5. Achieve a 70% attendee retention rate compared to the previous year.
6. Reduce carbon emissions from the event by 90%.
7. Increase food and beverage sales by 35%.

Ensure your festival planning team understands and supports your goals so they can work effectively towards your event's mission.

02) Determine your festival’s budget

Now that you have a clear understanding of your festival goals, it's time to create a budget to bring those goals to life. Festival planning involves various expenses to consider, and here's a list of common items to include in your budget:

1. Venue rental costs
2. Talent or entertainment expenses
3. Catering and related costs
4. Sanitary facility expenses
5. Staffing and volunteer management
6. Health and safety measures (cleaning protocols, barriers, security personnel, etc.)
7. Equipment rentals
8. Security and permits from local authorities

It's essential to ensure that your budget remains within the expected revenue earnings from the event to maintain a positive return on investment (ROI).

03) Secure a festival venue

Choosing the right festival venue can greatly influence how attendees, performers, and vendors perceive the experience. To ensure you pick the ideal location, consider the following questions:

1. Is the venue easily accessible by public transit, and does it offer sufficient parking?
2. Can the venue accommodate your current attendee numbers, and does it have room for future growth?
3. Does it have the necessary infrastructure, including high voltage capacity?
4. Will you be able to bring in all the required vendors and equipment to the venue?

Once you've identified the perfect venue, secure a date, sign a contract, stay within your budget, and make necessary payments. Don't forget to obtain the required licenses and permits, such as those related to zoning and parking, to host the festival.

04) Book your festival’s lineup and vendors

Your festival's lineup and vendors play a crucial role in attracting potential attendees. To kick-start the booking process, follow these steps:

1. Identify your key attendee demographics and what motivates them to attend your event. This will help you align your catering services, entertainment acts, and vendors with your audience's preferences.

2. Create a list of desired performers and determine how to reach them, whether through social media, connections within your staff, or other means.

3. Explore a diverse selection of food and beverage vendors to cater to various attendee preferences, and consider partnering with local restaurants.

4. Develop a rough festival schedule and fill in gaps with innovative attractions and entertainment.

5. Share the festival schedule with artists and entertainment vendors, making any necessary changes.

6. When reaching out to performers and vendors, emphasize the benefits they can gain from participation, such as access to a new audience of potential fans or the opportunity to support a meaningful cause.

05) Build your festival marketing plan

All your event marketing messages should have a unique selling point that sets you apart from the competition and motivates people to take immediate action for event registrations.

For instance, you can highlight your festival's diverse food options or an entertainment lineup featuring emerging artists.

Once you've finalized your message, consider using the following channels for festival promotion:

1. Pay-per-click (PPC) advertisements: Utilize targeted PPC advertising across various channels like social media and Google to reach your desired audience. This approach allows you to reach a wide range of people and assess which channels are most effective.

2. Social media campaigns: Boost social media engagement by creating a distinct event hashtag on platforms like Instagram. Run ticket giveaways for followers who share your content, and create excitement with videos featuring your event's talent or sneak peeks of the schedule.

3. Influencer partnerships and giveaways: Collaborate with influencers who have significant social media followings or influence in their communities. Their endorsements and sharing can help you reach a new audience and create strong support for your event.

06) Coordinate volunteers and on-site staff for your festival

Your festival's success heavily relies on the dedicated work of volunteers and staff from your nonprofit. They play a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth operation of your event and the safety of attendees.

Here are key elements of an effective volunteer management strategy:

1. Assess your staffing needs. Identify the tasks essential for your festival's success and determine the number of volunteers required to complete these tasks.

2. Develop comprehensive volunteer role descriptions. Clearly outline the roles and responsibilities that volunteers will perform to maintain a well-staffed, clean, and secure festival. These roles could encompass ticket collection, parking management, or backstage coordination for performers.

3. Establish a volunteer schedule. Decide when, where, and what tasks you need volunteers to handle before, during, and after the event. Create a schedule specifying shifts and the corresponding volunteer roles.

4. Display shift opportunities on your event website's volunteer page and promote them through your marketing channels. This allows volunteers to view and sign up for shifts directly, reducing administrative work for your team.

5. Provide volunteers with a mobile app that grants quick access to their schedules, event maps, and a communication tool for questions and updates from festival coordinators.

For a streamlined and efficient volunteer management strategy in your festival planning, consider investing in an all-in-one volunteer management solution, such as Bloomerang's system. It offers a centralized platform to manage volunteer schedules, create customized recruitment processes, and personalize volunteer outreach. Volunteers also gain access to self-sign-up tools and a mobile app for seamless communication with your staff when needed.

07) Plan your festival’s schedule

Once you've sorted out your lineup, venue, and vendors, it's time to finalize your event schedule. Safety is a top priority, so ensure that people can move between activities and performances securely.

Share a venue map on your event's online page, marking parking areas, restrooms, dining spots, and emergency exits. A clear emergency plan should also be provided, outlining evacuation routes, procedures, and safety guidelines.

Promote your event schedule through social media, your website, and email newsletters in the weeks leading up to your festival.

08) Prep for last-minute tasks on event day

As you watch your festival planning come to fruition, it's essential to anticipate last-minute challenges that may arise in the days leading up to the event and on the day itself.

Here are a few tasks to be prepared for:

1. Equipment adjustments: Be ready to relocate barriers, tech equipment, and even tents in response to changing circumstances, like weather or security concerns.

2. Staff scheduling issues and no-shows: Use your volunteer management tool to communicate with volunteers, remind them of their shifts, and have a plan in place to recruit additional volunteers if needed.

3. Security staff briefing: Ensure your security team is well-informed about the event's security measures, including specific individuals not allowed entry and prohibited items to watch for at check-in.

Even the most meticulously planned festivals may encounter unexpected challenges on event day, so maintaining flexibility is crucial.

09) Thank participants and follow up with fundraising results

After your festival ends, it's essential to express gratitude to everyone who played a part, such as volunteers, attendees, donors, performers, and vendors. This not only fosters strong relationships but also enhances the likelihood of their participation in your future festivals.

Consider these ideas to express your appreciation to different groups:

1. Handwritten thank-you cards for volunteers.
2. Thank-you emails for event attendees and donors.
3. Gift baskets and other tokens of appreciation for performers.
4. Give shout-outs on social media to participating vendors.

Also, be sure to inform all participants about the fundraising outcomes and whether you met your goals. Explain how you plan to utilize the proceeds to advance your mission, such as acquiring new equipment or supporting specific projects and programs. Make it evident that the success of your festival was made possible by the support of everyone involved.
