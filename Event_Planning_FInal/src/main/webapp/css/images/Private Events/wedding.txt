01) Set Your Wedding Budget and Stick to It

Start by determining your wedding budget early on, as it will greatly influence your wedding choices. If family members are contributing, discuss their financial comfort. If you're covering the costs, assess your finances and plan for any necessary adjustments. Once you have a budget in mind, commit to it!

02) Construct a List of Wedding Priorities

Have a conversation with your partner to identify the top three crucial elements of your wedding. Is it the venue, a specific wedding date, or securing a particular photographer or live band? Give these aspects the highest priority and be open to negotiation on the others. This approach will assist you in budget management and concentrating on what truly matters.

03) Determine Your Wedding Style

Find your preferred bridal inspiration sources, such as Pinterest, Instagram, magazines, and reliable bridal websites (including Brides). Start your research to gain a clear understanding of your desired wedding style. However, don't get overwhelmed by the vast amount of inspiration available. It's wise to set a time limit for browsing through photos and ideas in one go. Creating a list of what you like, dislike, and your preferences will also aid in a more effective review of inspirational images.

04) Get Organized

Utilize various tools like checklists, spreadsheets, Word, Excel, Google Docs, or any platform that allows you to consolidate your ideas, budgets, figures, and more in a single location. Additionally, numerous excellent online tools and apps can help you stay organized. We recommend WeddingHappy for task management and AllSeated for visualizing seating arrangements and venue layouts.

05) Involve Your Significant Other

Remember, you don't have to go through the wedding planning journey by yourself. Regularly involve your partner in the process, as their input is likely to be extremely valuable. Collaborating on decisions, even if it's only for certain aspects, can make the wedding planning experience more enjoyable. Additionally, striving toward shared goals not only strengthens your relationship but also allows you to grow as a couple as you tackle challenges together.

06) Buy a Wedding Planning Book

For couples who decide to handle wedding planning without the assistance of a professional planner or coordinator, turning to traditional etiquette and guidebooks like "The Wedding Book" can be a valuable resource. These books are rich in information and expert guidance, offering tips, tricks, sample timelines, and checklists that can effectively reduce the stress that may arise during the planning process.

07) Create a Master Checklist

This tool will assist you in setting and ranking your objectives, preventing you from feeling inundated by handling everything simultaneously.

08) Think About Dates

Select a handful of preferred wedding dates and, if feasible, maintain some flexibility to avoid constraints when booking the venue and vendors. Consider external variables, including the popularity of these dates among other engaged couples (which can affect availability and prices), their convenience for your guests, and the cost variations among venues and vendors during different seasons.

09) Select a Theme

Whether you're drawn to particular wedding colors, inspired by a season or style, or even considering a thematic approach (such as the Roaring Twenties or Festival Chic), having a central concept for your wedding design can be quite beneficial. Once you've settled on a visual idea, it becomes simpler to make design choices, leading to a more unified and cohesive look throughout your wedding.

10) Consider Having an “On-Site” Wedding

In wedding terminology, an "off-site" wedding refers to a venue without a commercial kitchen, where you need to arrange for all necessities to be brought in. Think of locations like parks, public beaches, or open fields. On the other hand, hosting an "on-site" wedding at places like hotels or restaurants can significantly streamline the planning process because they typically offer various catering options, along with fundamental amenities like designated event spaces, seating, tables, and potentially an on-site coordinator to support your needs.

11) Start Working on Your Guest List

Making decisions about your guest list can be a complicated process and one that will depend largely on your venue and budget. So before you begin, sit down with your partner and key family members to put together a wish list of wedding guests. You will also need to decide whether you’re inviting children and who will be allotted a plus one.

12) Talk to Other Married Couples

Did you recently attend a wedding that left a positive impression? Don't hesitate to reach out to the newlyweds for guidance and valuable insights. They likely have valuable tips and tricks they picked up during their own wedding planning journey, and they'd be delighted to pass on their wisdom. Often, your friends and family can be an excellent source of advice.

13) Research Your Venue Options

Before finalizing your decision, make sure to research the costs, package details, and any limitations, such as minimum budget requirements or guest count, from various wedding and reception venues. Even if you find a venue and package that appeals to you, it's wise to continue exploring other alternatives. Seek input from others and compare pricing from different venues before committing to a specific offer.

14) Book Vendors You’re Comfortable With

When it comes to hiring wedding vendors, it's crucial not to make hasty decisions. Take the time to explore multiple options to ensure that these vital partners comprehend your vision and can accommodate your budget. Wedding vendors play a key role in ensuring your day is unforgettable and runs seamlessly, so it's important to choose a team you genuinely connect with. They should also grasp your vision and have your trust in executing it successfully.

15) Read Every Contract Closely 

Before finalizing any contracts with your wedding vendors, carefully scrutinize every aspect, including date, location, timing, deposits, additional charges, colors, and quantities. It's essential to have everything documented in the contract because it ensures protection in case of improper execution or misunderstandings.

Be cautious of contracts that prevent you from leaving reviews after the service (a red flag), extreme cancellation policies, or those that appear one-sided. A contract should specify what happens if either party cancels, not just the client.

Pay close attention to policies related to changes in the scope of service, which means that rates may be adjusted for significant modifications. For instance, if your catering contract was initially for 50 guests but you decide to invite 100, you might be charged an increased rate. Likewise, a venue might have a minimum guest count requirement, which can be problematic if your RSVP count is lower than the initial estimate.

16) Choose Your Wedding Party Wisely

The friends and family members you invite to be part of your wedding party play a crucial role in providing both emotional and practical support during the wedding planning and on the big day. Therefore, carefully choose individuals you genuinely want by your side for this momentous occasion, and ensure they can fulfill the responsibilities expected of them throughout the planning process. Additionally, discuss with your partner to determine the ideal size for your wedding party, considering the financial aspects that come with this important role.

17) Book Hotel Room Blocks

Whether your wedding is in a different location or locally, it's likely that some guests will need accommodation for the night of your wedding. It's a considerate gesture to arrange a hotel block at one or more preferred hotels to ensure all your wedding guests stay in close proximity. Many hotels may even offer discounted rates based on the number of rooms you reserve.

What's more, there are perks for the couple as well. Some hotels provide incentives like a complimentary room for the couple, free breakfast, or spa credits, so don't forget to ask about any extras.

18) Shop for Wedding Attire

When it comes to finding the ideal wedding gown, begin your search shortly after selecting your venue. Ideally, aim to purchase your dress nine months before your wedding to allow ample time for fittings and alterations. Start shopping for wedding party attire around seven to eight months before the wedding date, while groom and groomsman outfits can be sorted out at the five-month mark. Additionally, remember to plan outfits for pre-wedding events like brunches, showers, and rehearsals.

19) Pick Invitations and Save the Dates

Once you've determined your wedding style and secured the venue, it's a good idea to begin planning your wedding stationery. Save-the-date cards should be sent out about nine months before the wedding for destination weddings and four to six months ahead for local weddings. Follow up with the invitation suite about six to eight weeks before the wedding day. For RSVPs, make sure to request them at least one month prior to the celebration to avoid any last-minute issues.

20) Organize Transportation

There are three types of wedding transportation to think about. First, you may need transportation for you and the wedding party to the ceremony, depending on the venue. After the ceremony, you'll need a getaway car to take you and your spouse to the reception, while the wedding party uses the earlier transportation. If your venue is in a remote area or you have out-of-town guests, it's considerate to arrange group transportation to move them between the ceremony, reception, and their hotels. This is where hotel blocks can be helpful. For a unique touch, consider using transportation that complements the surroundings.
