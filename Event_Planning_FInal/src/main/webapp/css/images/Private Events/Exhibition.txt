1. Formulate the core concept of your exhibition. Define the central message you intend to convey to your audience.

2. Determine the key themes of the exhibition and begin contemplating the overall progression of the exhibit. Consider what essential information viewers need.

3. Select the objects to feature in your exhibition. Analyze the stories they tell, their intrinsic appeal, and their contribution to the central idea.

4. Develop the exhibition's narrative. Ensure that every element in the exhibition aligns with the story you aim to share.
