Introduction

Meetings and events serve as platforms where knowledgeable speakers share valuable information with their audience. However, beyond the dissemination of knowledge, many attendees are also driven by the desire to expand their networks and connect with individuals who can provide valuable connections.

The age-old adage "It's not what you know, but who you know" highlights the importance of building relationships. In addition to delivering a great event experience with immersive technology, engaging booths, and reputable speakers, offering networking opportunities is equally vital.

While attendees may leave an event with giveaways and informational pamphlets, the key to making your event truly unforgettable lies in providing appealing networking prospects. Fortunately, innovative technology is now empowering event planners to make networking opportunities more accessible, convenient, and efficient. This technology enables like-minded attendees to connect throughout the entire event lifecycle.

How to Foster Networking Among Event Attendees

Modern events go beyond the realm of passive listening to speakers or attending sessions; they're about cultivating meaningful connections with fellow attendees. The more networking opportunities an event offers, the more valuable it becomes for participants.

When attendees depart from your event, they often ponder, "How many significant connections did I establish today?" Their assessment of the event's success hinges on this factor and can influence their willingness to attend future gatherings, meetings, and conferences. So, how can you effectively facilitate networking at your events? Here are five valuable tips:

Creating Anticipation with a Pre-event Online Community

The cornerstone of successful networking is to initiate connections among like-minded event participants as early as possible. Ideally, registrants should be able to identify networking prospects shortly after signing up for your event.

To jumpstart networking weeks or even days before your event, consider establishing a closed online community that grants registrants immediate access upon registration. This pre-event online community should provide a conducive space for registrants to begin conversations with each other. Integration of this pre-event community into your event app ensures convenience and accessibility. Moreover, it not only fosters networking but also generates excitement for the event, potentially increasing attendance rates.

Crafting a Thoughtful Networking Strategy

While some meaningful business connections arise serendipitously, attendees greatly appreciate a well-planned strategy that helps them connect with the right individuals during the event.

Leveraging an event networking platform can facilitate this process. Organize small breakout sessions for attendees to join, assist them in scheduling meetings with specific people, and encourage intimate face-to-face interactions with exhibitors and keynote speakers.

Harnessing Digital Badges

Modern digital badges can replace traditional paper business cards. Attendees can easily exchange contact information with a simple tap, making networking more efficient and enjoyable. These digital badges can seamlessly integrate with your mobile event app, offering a comprehensive event technology experience. Additionally, smart badges may capture valuable event data, such as the most-visited booths and engaging exhibitors.

Exploring Creative Networking Activities

For events where attendees prefer less formal networking, creative and playful tactics can be highly effective. Speed networking, for instance, has gained popularity as it enables even reserved participants to form meaningful connections during the event. Similar to speed dating, each participant spends a limited time with others. Proper pre-event organization is essential to ensure that like-minded participants are grouped together. Digital badges can also simplify contact information exchange.

Other innovative networking activities include human bingo, competitive networking (e.g., awarding a prize to the person who makes the most new connections), and conditional discounts from exhibitors.

Establishing Networking-Conducive Spaces

Many events have broader objectives beyond networking, especially non-corporate ones. The key is to create spaces and pocket networking activities that complement the main event.

Consider these ideas:

1. Networking Hubs: Transform common areas such as coffee stands, lounges, and snack bars into networking corners.
2. Pre-event Kick-Off for New Attendees: Especially beneficial for recurring events with repeat attendees, this pre-event kick-off ensures first-timers do not feel left out.
3. Big Idea Wall: Set up a freedom wall, big idea wall, or solutions wall, where attendees can share their thoughts along with their contact information for others to see.

Intelligent Matchmaking

Effective event planners are skilled network builders. While attendees ultimately influence the results of their networking efforts, you bear the responsibility of crafting an event strategy and facilitating activities to simplify participants' connections with the right people at the right time. Thoughtful strategies, creative thinking, and technology, such as an event management platform, can transform your event into a networking hub for attendees.

Tips for Thriving at Your Next Networking Event

For those who find social interactions challenging, attending a networking event and mingling with strangers may seem daunting. However, there are several tips and icebreakers that can make initiating conversations less intimidating:

1. Partner Up: Attend the event with a referral partner or someone who shares your client base. This not only provides company but also promotes each other's businesses.

2. Be a Host: Take on a hosting role, assisting others in finding amenities, welcoming newcomers, and engaging them in conversation to make them feel comfortable.

3. Arrive Early: Being one of the first attendees gives you a more manageable crowd to navigate as more people arrive.

4. Come Prepared: Prepare three conversation starters and four generic questions to facilitate discussions. These can cover topics like vacation destinations or recent experiences.

5. Ask and Listen: Asking open-ended questions and actively listening to the responses can be more effective than talking extensively.

6. Lose the Elevator Pitch: Rather than reciting memorized pitches, focus on building genuine connections through engaging conversations.

7. Icebreakers: Utilize icebreakers such as, "Do you mind me saying hello and introducing myself?" or, "What do you think of the speaker/host?" to initiate conversations.

By following these tips and implementing technology, event planners can enhance networking experiences and create meaningful connections for attendees. Collecting data to match attendees with like-minded peers, providing a mobile event app for networking, sharing attendee lists, enabling direct messaging, offering interactive floor plans, and integrating social media platforms are among the strategies that can bolster networking at events. Additionally, digital badges can streamline contact information exchange. Post-event, attendees can exchange contact information through digital badges. Using analytics tools, event planners can track the success of these interactions and refine their future events accordingly.

In conclusion, networking with strangers may be daunting, but with the right approach and technology, it can become a more manageable and even enjoyable part of attending events.

The landscape of events has been transformed by technology. Gone are the days of entering events with uncertainty about the people you'll meet. Nowadays, you can pre-schedule meetings, coordinate calendars, and even research potential attendees, turning networking into an exciting prospect.

As conferences and events increasingly adopt hybrid models, organizers and sponsors face the challenge of maintaining attendee engagement and networking opportunities without overshadowing the sessions, speakers, and the event as a whole.

Mobile devices and social networking have become integral to the event industry, and we can expect event planners to continue finding innovative ways to harness these technologies, making event networking more efficient and enriching for attendees.
